	Check .gitignore File
	Sometimes, files are not being staged because they are listed in the .gitignore file. The .gitignore file tells Git to ignore certain files and directories.
	Check if the image files (or other files with the question mark symbol) are being ignored by reviewing the .gitignore file.
	If they are listed, and you want them to be staged, remove them from .gitignore or update the .gitignore rules appropriately.
